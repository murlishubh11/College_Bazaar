#This Project aims to connect University students to sell and buy their used items. Sellers get a convenient platform to list their items, and Buyers get books and other articles at low prices, along with a chat feature to clear any queries they may have with the product
**Have a look at [website](https://college-bazaar-coderelay.netlify.app/)**

### We have implemented an online market for college students to sell and buy their products
**1** There are two types of users: admins and students<br/>
**2** Admins verify the users as well as any product uploaded for sell.<br/>
**3** Unverified product cannot be purchased, and unverified users cannot login.<br/>
**4** If any unwanted, bad product is uploaded on the website, admins can remove it, *College Bazaar* will notify the student about the same.<br/>
**5** Admins can blacklist any user from website, so that they can't sell product anymore.<br/>
**6** Online payments can be made through any payment methods like cards, upi, etc.<br/>
**7** And many more features...

### Thankyou
